Status: <strong>Not started (no solutions uploaded yet).</strong>

According to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/):

*Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job. In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning. You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.*
