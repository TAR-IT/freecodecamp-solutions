Status: <strong>Not started (no solutions uploaded yet).</strong>

According to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/):

*For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects. These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage. Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases. Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.*
